## Features
By the end of the two weeks we spent building this webshop, we developed the following features: 

1. Registration and Sign In Process using the Devise gem
2. Role Based Authorization using the CanCanCan gem - admins are able to create and delete products
3. User Profile Page
4. Catalog Display with all the available products
5. Single Page Product
6. Shopping cart using sessions; AJAX calls to update the cart when a product is added
7. Sorting filters and search bar
8. Checkout and payment process
9. Unit Tests

## Installation

1. Make sure [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#installing-rails) are installed in your system

2. Clone the repository

3. Install all dependencies
